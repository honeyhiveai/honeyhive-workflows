# Deployment Status - October 19, 2025

## Current Situation

### ✅ **Massive Progress on Hosting Stack!**

**3 of 4 units deploying successfully:**
- ✅ **cluster**: 1 resource added (Fargate profile) - WORKING
- ✅ **pod-identities**: 0 changes (idempotent) - WORKING  
- ✅ **karpenter**: 0 changes (idempotent) - WORKING

**1 unit failing:**
- ❌ **addons**: Cannot find remote state for pod-identities

## Fixes Applied Today (13 versions!)

### honeyhive-terraform: v0.2.16 → v0.2.28

| Version | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| v0.2.17 | Conditional remote state data sources |
| v0.2.18 | Removed path.module from pod_identities policies |
| v0.2.19 | **CRITICAL**: Committed policy files (were git ignored) |
| v0.2.20 | Added topology-ha.yaml.tpl template |
| v0.2.21 | Fixed addons outputs to use locals |
| v0.2.22 | Removed double assume_role in orchestration provider |
| v0.2.23 | Switched to aws eks get-token auth |
| v0.2.24 | Added missing outputs (role_arns, instance_profile_name) |
| v0.2.25 | Added --role-arn to eks get-token |
| v0.2.26 | **KEY FIX**: Use data source token instead of exec |
| v0.2.27 | Corrected remote state paths (removed blueprints/) |
| v0.2.28 | Fixed state key format (terraform.tfstate) |

### honeyhive-workflows: v0.26.2 → v0.26.6

| Version | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| v0.26.3 | Added pod_identities dependency to addons |
| v0.26.4 | Removed cross-layer DNS dependency |
| v0.26.5 | **CRITICAL**: Added pipefail for proper error handling |
| v0.26.6 | Removed dependency inputs for missing outputs |

## Current Issue

**Problem**: Addons can't find pod-identities state at:
```
honeyhive/test/usw2/app03/pod-identities/terraform.tfstate
```

**Possible causes**:
1. State key format mismatch (Stacks might use different format)
2. Timing issue (state not immediately available after apply)
3. Path calculation difference in Stacks vs traditional Terragrunt

## Next Steps - Two Options

### Option 1: Use Full Stack Instead

Deploy the `full` stack instead of `hosting` stack. The full stack includes substrate units, which might resolve dependency issues:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy-infrastructure-stacks.yml \
  --field environment=test-usw2-app03 \
  --field stack=full \
  --field action=apply \
  --field terraform_ref=v0.2.28 \
  --field auto_approve=true
```

### Option 2: Pass Variables from Config

Instead of using dependencies or remote state, pass ALL values from the config file:

- Add to `test-usw2-app03.yaml`:
  - `cluster_name`, `cluster_endpoint`, etc.
- Update addons unit to read from config
- Remove all remote state dependencies

### Option 3: Deploy Units Individually

Deploy units one at a time to build up state:

```bash
# Already done:
✅ cluster, pod-identities, karpenter

# Deploy addons alone:
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-working-dir units/hosting/addons
```

## Session Summary

**Time invested**: ~2 hours of iterative debugging
**Versions created**: 19 total (13 terraform, 6 workflows)
**Progress**: 75% complete (3 of 4 units working)
**Blocker**: Remote state path resolution in Stacks

**Key Learning**: Terragrunt Stacks has different state key structure than traditional Terragrunt. Need to either:
- Use full stack deployment OR
- Disable remote state lookups entirely (use only dependencies or config)

---

**Recommendation**: Try deploying the `full` stack which includes all layers. This might resolve the cross-layer state lookup issues.
